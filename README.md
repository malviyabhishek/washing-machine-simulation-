# washing-machine-simulation-


This is one of the EMBEDDED Internship Project done during the Intership at EMERTXE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PVT LTD..
## INTRODUCTION
The machine is capable of washing, rinsing and dry-spinning clothes. The intelligence of the machine was based on PIC16F877A microcontroller.
This provides the sequence of instructions that controls the machine from start to finish according to the washing mode selected.
A washing machine is a mechanism designed to wash laundry, such as clothing, towels, and sheets. The term is mostly applied only to machines that utilize water as the primary cleaning solution, in contrast to dry cleaning (which uses alternative cleaning  fluids, and is performed by  specialist businesses) or ultrasonic cleaners.

## Installation
[MPLAB XIDE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6Rmj98yI7_Y5H--lwe8m4DN3FVB0o-k4u7y-e0-T-w_9Cct4qIL2pq20aAkIFEALw_wcB#tabs)

[PICSIMLAB](https://sourceforge.net/projects/picsim/)

[MPLAB Compiler](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6Rmj-KmEgeZLWYdpD2qr2bs3wJx5kiOpLbDUEuGerZoyp6GZ4tR-WrMQaAltBEALw_wcB)
   
## Steps to Run Project
To run this project 

1.Download  the code this zip file

2.Extract the files 

3.open mplabXide >open project>Select the path of extracted file>select open project.

4.Once the project file opens,right click select batch build to build project.

5.After the code is Build Succesfully observe the file dictionary of hex file genarated.

6.Now,go for Picsimlab choose >Board -picgenosis ,Microcontroller-Pic16F877A.

7.And now go for file select the path for hexfile load the hexfile 

8.Pressing the  defined switches we could see the display for differnt washing machine program
